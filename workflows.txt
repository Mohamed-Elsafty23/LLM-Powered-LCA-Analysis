First approach for the project 
prepare vector database for the literature papers after making text processing for them and then text analysis 
RAW input data 
component analysis for the raw input data
full lca analyses for the component analyses
generate one logical search query for the input and then find similar papers from the vector database of the literature papers
then make sustainability report 
finally, make visualization for lca and sustainability reports 



Second approach 
RAW input data 
hotspot analysis for the raw input directly
for every hotspot, generate specific search query 
for each search query, get papers from arXiv API, make pdf processing for them 
make the sustainability report based on evidence based for the hotspot analyses, papers got from arXiv, and web search tool if needed more quatative information
