    "abstract": "The steep increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has created great concern due to its role in the greenhouse effect and global warming. One approach to mitigate CO2 levels involves its application in specific technologies. In this context, CO2 can be used for a more sustainable synthesis of polycarbonates (CO2-PCs). In this research, CO2-PC films and composites with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, ranging from 0.2 to 7.0 wt.%) have been prepared to achieve more sustainable multifunctional sensing devices."
