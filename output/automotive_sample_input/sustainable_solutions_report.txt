SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS REPORT
==================================================

**Introduction**

This report aims to propose improvements to the baseline environmental impacts identified in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The LCA report provides a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phases of the ECU. This report will review and organize the analyses of sustainable solutions from research papers to identify potential improvements to these baseline impacts.
