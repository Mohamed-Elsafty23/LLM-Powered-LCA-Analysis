### Critical Gaps
There are several critical gaps in the available data:
- Limited information on the specific materials and processes used in the Transportation component
- Lack of direct quantitative data on waste generation and water usage
- Insufficient information on the economic benefits of the proposed solutions

Web search data provides additional insights:
- The US EPA estimates that the transportation sector accounts for 27% of total US greenhouse gas emissions [Transportation Sector Emissions | US EPA - U.S. Environmental ...] (URL: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/transportation-sector-emissions)
- The Ohio Department of Transportation has implemented a carbon reduction strategy to minimize congestion and encourage modes of travel with lower emissions [Ohio Carbon Reduction Strategy - Ohio Department of Transportation] (URL: https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/programs/statewide-planning-research/statewide-transportation-planning/02a-carbonreductionstrategy)
