      "overview": "This Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report provides an evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phases of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU).",
      "key_findings": {
        "production_impact": "The production phase of the ECU housing has a total environmental impact of 0.365 kg CO2 eq, with 0.141 kg CO2 eq attributed to material impacts and 0.224 kg CO2 eq attributed to manufacturing processes.",
        "distribution_impact": "The distribution phase has a total environmental impact of 0.124 kg CO2 eq, with 0.088 kg CO2 eq attributed to transportation and 0.036 kg CO2 eq attributed to packaging.",
        "use_impact": "The use phase has a total environmental impact of 89.993 kg CO2 eq, with energy consumption being the primary contributor.",
