The analysis also considers different usage scenarios, including low, default, and high usage. The environmental impacts of energy consumption are quantified using metrics such as CO2 equivalent emissions.",
      "end_of_life_phase": "The end-of-life phase analysis evaluates the recycling potential and disposal methods of the ECU's components, including metals, plastics, and printed circuit boards (PCBs). The environmental benefits of recycling and the impacts of disposal methods are quantified using metrics such as avoided emissions and disposal costs.",

The data is used to calculate the environmental impacts of each life cycle phase and to identify areas for improvement.",
      "limitations": "The study's limitations include the availability and accuracy of data, as well as the assumptions made during the analysis. The results should be interpreted in the context of these limitations and used to inform decision-making and identify areas for further study."
