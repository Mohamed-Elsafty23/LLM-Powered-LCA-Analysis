      "overview": "The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) has been conducted, focusing on the production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phases.",
      "key_findings": {
        "production_phase": "The production phase analysis revealed energy consumption values for the Monitoring System (0.3 units) and Inverter (1.8 units), but lacked quantitative data on material weights and environmental impacts.",
        "distribution_phase": "The distribution phase analysis was limited due to the absence of transportation distance/method data, packaging materials, and weights.",
        "use_phase": "The use phase analysis was restricted by the lack of explicit usage data for ECU components, operating conditions, and correlation between weight and energy impacts.",
        "end_of_life_phase": "The end-of-life phase analysis was hindered by the absence of explicit recycling rates, disposal methods, and material recyclability data."

      "data_limitations": "The analysis was constrained by significant data limitations, including the lack of quantitative data on material weights, environmental impacts, and production volumes.",
      "recommendations": "To improve the accuracy and completeness of the LCA, it is essential to collect and provide more detailed and quantitative data on the ECU's life cycle, particularly in the areas of material weights, environmental impacts, production volumes, and end-of-life processing."
