SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS REPORT
==================================================

**Introduction**

This report aims to propose improvements to the baseline environmental impacts of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) as identified in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report. The LCA report highlights significant environmental impacts across the production, distribution, use, and end-of-life phases of ECUs. This report will analyze the baseline impacts and propose potential solutions from the analyzed research papers to reduce these impacts.
