6. Natural radioactivity background rate: 0.42 events/year.
7. Background rate due to neutron-induced γ’s without HDPE shielding: 1492 ± 93 events/year.
8. Background rate due to β decay in the fiducial volume without HDPE shielding: 38.7 ± 1.6 events/year.

**TECHNOLOGIES/METHODS:**
1. Geant4 simulations for studying neutron background.
2. HDPE (high-density polyethylene) shielding for reducing neutron background.
3. Lead shield for stopping environmental γ’s.

**PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:**
1. Using HDPE filler between the lead shield and the SSV reduces the amount of HDPE needed.
2. Increasing the abundance of 82Se in the Se isotopes decreases the total neutron absorption cross-section, resulting in a lower neutron background rate.

**RELEVANCE TO Steel_Punching_and_Bending:**
No direct relevance to Steel_Punching_and_Bending is found in the paper, as it focuses on reducing neutron background in the NνDEx experiment.
