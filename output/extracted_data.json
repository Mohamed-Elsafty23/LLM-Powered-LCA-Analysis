Concurrently, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are frequently found in sludge treatment and disposal systems, posing significant risks to both human health and wildlife. Metabolically versatile microorganisms originating from sewage sludge are inevitably introduced to sludge treatment and disposal systems, potentially affecting the fate of POPs. However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive assessments regarding the capability of sewage sludge microbiota from geographically disparate regions to attenuate POPs and the underpinning microbiomes. Results: Here we report the global prevalence of organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) known for their capacity to attenuate POPs in sewage sludge, with an occurrence frequency of ~50% in the investigated samples (605 of 1186). Subsequent laboratory tests revealed microbial reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), one of the most notorious categories of POPs, in 80 out of 84 sludge microcosms via various pathways."

      "abstract": "Battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) ensure that lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EVs) are operated in an optimal temperature range to achieve high performance and reduce risks. A conventional BTMS operates either as an active system that uses forced air, water or immersion cooling, or as a complete passive system without any temperature control. Passive systems function without any active energy supply and are therefore economically and environmentally advantageous. However, today’s passive BTMSs have limited cooling performance, which additionally cannot be controlled."
